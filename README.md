Spare is the worldâ€™s first block chain to utilize the revolutionary new consensus algorithm Proof of Space and Time (PoST) AND recycled crypto resources, allowing it to be farmed on existing Chia plots

Python 3.7+ is required. Make sure your default python version is >=3.7
by typing `python3`.

### MacOS build
```
git clone https://github.com/Spare-Network/spare-blockchain
cd spare-blockchain

sh install.sh
. ./activate

sh install-gui.sh

cd spare-blockchain-gui

### Update
```
cd spare-blockchain
. ./activate
spare stop -d all
deactivate
git fetch
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD

# If you get RELEASE.dev0 then delete the package-lock.json in spare-blockchain-gui and install.sh again

git status

# git status should say "nothing to commit, working tree clean", 
# if you have uncommitted changes, RELEASE.dev0 will be reported.

sh install.sh

. ./activate

spare init

# The GUI requires you have Ubuntu Desktop or a similar windowing system installed.
# You can not install and run the GUI as root

#### Troubleshooting

Sometimes stray daemons left over from previously running processes will cause strange bugs/errors when upgrading to a new version. Make sure all daemons and spare processes are killed before installing or upgrading.

This is normally done by executing spare stop -d all from the upgrade example above.
But it doesn't hurt to double check using ps -Af | grep spare to make sure there are no spare processes left running. You may have to manually kill the spare daemon if an install and spare start was performed without first running spare stop -d all

If all else fails, rebooting the machine and restarting the spare daemon/processes usually does the trick.
